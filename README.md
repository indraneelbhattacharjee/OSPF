# OSPF

The code establishes an SSH connection to a Cisco router using Netmiko and enters enable mode. 
It then sends a set of configuration commands to the router to configure OSPF, including specifying the router ID, configuring OSPF areas, and specifying which networks should participate in OSPF. 
Finally, the code prints the output of the configuration commands and disconnects from the router.
Note that the specific commands used to configure OSPF will depend on the vendor and model of the router, as well as the desired configuration.
The Netmiko library provides support for a wide range of network devices and vendors, so be sure to consult the documentation for the library and the specific device you are configuring to ensure that the appropriate commands are used.
